    Calculates the n-D Pearson's r correlation

    given coordinates.

    Returns a cube of the correlation between the two
    cubes along the dimensions of the given
    coordinates, at each point in the remaining
    dimensions of the cubes.

    For example providing two time/altitude/latitude/longitude
    cubes and corr_coords of 'latitude' and 'longitude' will result
    in a time/altitude cube describing the latitude/longitude
    (i.e. pattern) correlation at each time/altitude point.

    Args:

    * cube_a, cube_b (cubes):

        Cubes should be the same shape and have the

        correlations. If no names are provided then
